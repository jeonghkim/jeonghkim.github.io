<p> Welcome to my website! I am an Assistant Professor of Political Science at Louisiana State University. My research and teaching interests encompass political behavior, representation, gender and politics, and public opinion in comparative contexts.

My recent work investigates the conditions that support political inclusion of marginalized groups. I explore the relationship between direct democracy and political engagement among women as well as how the use of direct democracy influences inequalities in political participation across social groups.

In other ongoing projects, I explore womenâ€™s representation, the dynamics of party competitions, and public opinion on climate change. My research has been published or is forthcoming in the American Journal of Political Science and Comparative Political Studies.

I received my Ph.D. in Political Science from Washington University in St. Louis in 2018.<p>
