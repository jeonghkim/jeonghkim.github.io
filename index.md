<p> Welcome to my website! I am an Associate Professor of Political Science and International Studies at Yonsei University in Seoul, South Korea. I am a comparative politics scholar who uses gender and politics as a central analytical framework for studying political representation and public opinion in advanced democracies. My recent work applies a gender and politics lens to pressing contemporary challenges to democracy, such as backlash to equality policies, declining trust in political institutions, and demographic shifts, revealing the critical role of gender in how these structural changes transform political landscapes.</p>
  
<p> My research has been funded by the Center for American Women and Politics at Rutgers University, the APSA Centennial Center, the Academy of Korean Studies, and the Carrie Chapman Catt Center for Women and Politics. It has been published or forthcoming in the <i> American Journal of Political Science</i>, <i>Journal of Politics</i>, <i>  Comparative Political Studies</i>, <i>British Journal of Political Science</i>, <i>Public Opinion Quarterly</i>, <i>Legislative Studies Quarterly</i>, among other outlets. My work on the intersection of class and gender dynamics in political representation appears in the Cambridge University Press's <i>Elements in Gender and Politics</i>. </p>

<p> I received my Ph.D. in Political Science from Washington University in St. Louis in 2018. Before joining Yonsei, I was an assistant professor at Louisiana State University. </p>
