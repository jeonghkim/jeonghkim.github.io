<center> <img src="/img/Kim_picture_2016.jpg" class="right" alt="JKim profile" height="150" width="100"> </center> <p> Welcome to my website! I am an Assistant Professor of Political Science at <a href="https://www.lsu.edu/hss/polisci/" target="_blank"> Louisiana State University</a>. I work in the field of comparative politics with a focus on political participation, gender and politics, and representation. </p>

<p> I received my Ph.D. in Political Science from <a href="http://polisci.wustl.edu//" target="_blank"> Washington University in St. Louis </a> in 2018. My dissertation investigates the conditions that support political inclusion of marginalized groups. Using historical data and panel survey, I explore the relationship between direct democracy and political engagement among women as well as how the use of direct democracy influences inequalities in political participation across social groups.</p>

<p>In other projects, I study womenâ€™s representation, the dynamics of party competitions, and public opinion on climate change. My research has been published or is forthcoming in the <i> American Journal of Political Science </i> and <i> Comparative Political Studies.</i> </p>
