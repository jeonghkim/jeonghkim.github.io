<p> Welcome to my website! I am an Assistant Professor of Political Science at <a href="https://www.lsu.edu/hss/polisci/" target="_blank"> Louisiana State University</a>. My research and teaching interests encompass political behavior, representation, gender and politics, and public opinion in comparative contexts. </p>

<p> My recent work investigates the conditions that support political inclusion of marginalized groups. I explore the relationship between direct democracy and political engagement among women as well as how the use of direct democracy influences inequalities in political participation across social groups.</p>

<p>In other ongoing projects, I explore womenâ€™s representation, the dynamics of party competitions, and public opinion on climate change. My research has been published or is forthcoming in the <i> American Journal of Political Science </i> and <i> Comparative Political Studies.</i> </p>

<p>I received my Ph.D. in Political Science from <a href="http://polisci.wustl.edu//" target="_blank"> Washington University in St. Louis in 2018. </a> </p>
