<p> My research focuses on political inequality in democracies. 
Specifically, I investigate (1) sources and consequences of unequal participation and representation 
and (2) conditions that mitigate the political inequality.</p>

<p> More broadly, I am interested in behavioral effects of political institutions and the link between citizens' lived experience and political attitudes. </p>
