    <h2> Direct Democracy and Women’s Political Engagement </h2><p> <b> 2019. Published at <i> American Journal of Political Science </i> </b> <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/ajps.12420" target="_blank"> Link </a> </p>
 <p> In this paper, I propose that the presence of direct democracy expands the gender
equality in political participation. Leveraging a quasi-experiment in Sweden in the aftermath of the
introduction of universal suffrage, I find that the gender gap in electoral participation was smaller in municipalities using direct democracy than in similarly-sized municipalities that only had representative institutions.</p>

   <h2> The Gendered Effect of Direct Democracy on Political Efficacy </h2> <p> <b>  Under Review </b> </p> 
  <p> Using an original panel survey before and after the abortion referendum in Ireland, I demonstrate that achieving a desired outcome through voting in direct democracy induces a short-term increase in citizens' sense of political efficacy. The findings also suggest that this participatory effect is more pronounced among political minorities, mitigating the existing gap in political efficacy between the political majority and minority. <p> <i> Winner of Best Paper by an Emerging Scholar Award presented at 2019 MPSA </i> </p> </p>

  <h2> Status Threat and Opposition to Gender Equality Policies: Evidence from a Survey Experiment in South Korea</h2> <p> <b>  Under Review </b> <br>(With Yesola Kweon) </p>
  <p> Despite the increasing efforts to implement gender equality policies, many countries still encounter substantial popular opposition against these policies. We develop and test a theoretical framework linking men’s perceived status threat to their attitudes toward gender equality policies. First, we expect that men’s perceptions of status threat will trigger negative attitudes toward gender equality policies. Second, we expect that this status threat will have more profound effects among young men with a heightened degree of economic insecurity. To test these arguments, we fielded a survey experiment with a representative sample in South Korea. Our findings demonstrate the strong influence of status threats in the formation of negative attitudes toward legislative gender quotas among young men. This conclusion presents significant implications for the study of gender and politics and democratic representation. Further, this study informs policy makers of ways to mandate an inclusive policy without incurring social conflicts. </p>

  <h2> How Economic Integration Affects Party Issue Emphases.</h2> <p> <b> 2015. Published at <i> Comparative Political Studies </i> </b> <br>(With Dalston Ward, Matthew Graham, and Margit Tavits)  <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0010414015576745" target="_blank"> Link </a> </p>
  
  <p> In this article, we argue that integration into global markets constrains parties’ abilities to credibly differentiate themselves on economic issues. Given these constraints, and voters’ awareness of them, parties activate other non-economic issues along which to compete. Using data across 49 countries between 1961 and 2010, this study shows that increased economic integration is associated with increased emphasis on non-economic issues during election campaigns. </p>
