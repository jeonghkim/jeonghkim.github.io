    <h2> Direct Democracy and Women’s Political Engagement </h2>
  <p> <b>  Forthcoming at <i> American Journal of Political Science </i> </b>. </p> 
  <p> In this paper, I propose that the presence of direct democracy expands the gender
equality in political participation. Leveraging a quasi-experiment in Sweden in the aftermath of the
introduction of universal suffrage, I find that the gender gap in electoral participation was smaller in municipalities using direct democracy than in similarly-sized municipalities that only had representative institutions.</p>

   <h2> Empowering Decisions: Direct Democracy, Citizen Participation, and Political Efficacy </h2>
  <p> <b>  Under Review </b> </p> 
  <p> Using an original panel survey before and after the abortion referendum in Ireland, I demonstrate that achieving a desired outcome through voting in direct democracy induces a short-term increase in citizens' sense of political efficacy. The findings also suggest that this participatory effect is more pronounced among political minorities, mitigating the existing gap in political efficacy between the political majority and minority. </p>
