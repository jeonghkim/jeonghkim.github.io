  <p><b>Double Glass Ceiling: The Class Effects of Gender Representation </b>(with Yesola Kweon) <br> Forthcoming in Cambridge University Press, <i>Element Series on Gender and Politics</i> 
  <br>Working-class women are severely underrepresented in political bodies across the world. We uncover the political significance of class-based representation gaps among women. We theorize and empirically demonstrate how working-class women's distinct socioeconomic circumstances shape their policy priorities. We show that when these priorities go unrepresented due to working-class women's underrepresentation in politics, the result is decreased political efficacy, trust, and engagement among working-class women, thereby exacerbating both class-based and gender-based inequalities. This research contributes to gender and politics scholarship by advancing our understanding of how intersectionality of class and gender structures political representation.
