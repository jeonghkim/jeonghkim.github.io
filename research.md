   <h2> Empowering Decisions: Direct Democracy, Citizen Participation, and Political Efficacy </h2>
  <p> <b>  Under Review </b> </p> 
  <p> Using an original panel survey before and after the abortion referendum in Ireland, I demonstrate that achieving a desired outcome through voting in direct democracy induces a short-term increase in citizens' sense of political efficacy. The findings also suggest that this participatory effect is more pronounced among political minorities, mitigating the existing gap in political efficacy between the political majority and minority. </p>
