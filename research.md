    <h2> Direct Democracy and Women’s Political Engagement </h2><p> <b>  Forthcoming at <i> American Journal of Political Science </i> </b> <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/ajps.12420" target="_blank"> Link </a> 
 <p> In this paper, I propose that the presence of direct democracy expands the gender
equality in political participation. Leveraging a quasi-experiment in Sweden in the aftermath of the
introduction of universal suffrage, I find that the gender gap in electoral participation was smaller in municipalities using direct democracy than in similarly-sized municipalities that only had representative institutions.</p>

   <h2> Empowering Decisions: Direct Democracy, Citizen Participation, and Political Efficacy </h2> <p> <b>  Under Review </b> </p> 
  <p> Using an original panel survey before and after the abortion referendum in Ireland, I demonstrate that achieving a desired outcome through voting in direct democracy induces a short-term increase in citizens' sense of political efficacy. The findings also suggest that this participatory effect is more pronounced among political minorities, mitigating the existing gap in political efficacy between the political majority and minority. </p>

  <h2> How Economic Integration Affects Party Issue Emphases.</h2> <p> <b> 2015. Comparative Political Studies, 48(10), pp.1227-1259. </b> (With Dalston Ward, Matthew Graham, and Margit Tavits)  <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0010414015576745" target="_blank"> Link </a></p>
  
  <p> In this article, we argue that integration into global markets constrains parties’ abilities to credibly differentiate themselves on economic issues. Given these constraints, and voters’ awareness of them, parties activate other non-economic issues along which to compete. Using data across 49 countries between 1961 and 2010, this study shows that increased economic integration is associated with increased emphasis on non-economic issues during election campaigns. </p>

<section class="spotlight"> <h2> Islamic Rule and Women's Representation </h2> <p> Working Paper (with Deniz Aksoy) </p> 
  <p> This paper investigates the effect of a pro-Islamist local government on participation of women in local politics. We use a unique dataset of Turkish local elections results and data on gender of municipal council candidates who ran for office. Using a regression
discontinuity design, we compare the number of female candidates in districts where the mayoral candidates from the pro-Islamist party, AKP, narrowly lost or won local elections. We find that election of a mayor from a pro-Islamist party leads to a lower
share of females running as candidates in municipal councils. </p>
