  <h2>Courses</h2>
  <h3>  Introduction to Comparative Politics</h3>  <i>Louisiana State University (Undergraduate) </i>
  <br> This course provides an introduction to fundamental concepts, theories
and questions of the study of comparative politics. We will learn topics central
to understanding the political systems and political events around the world: democratization,
voting and elections, political parties, representation, and political violence. This course will give
students a basic understanding of how politics operates in the political systems around the world,
and how historical, cultural, economic, and institutional differences across countries affect politics
and policy-making.

<h3>Voting, Campaigns, and Elections</h3> <i>Louisiana State University (Undergraduate) </i>
  <br> Why do some people turn out to vote while others don't? What explains citizens' voting behavior and vote decisions? In what ways do candidates and parties mobilize voters? In this course, we will explore these fundamental questions of mass and elite political behavior in democracies. While some readings draw on American politics, we will also learn about cross-national differences and similarities in electoral processes and electoral institutions. The first part of this course will examine different models to explain individual and cross-national variations in electoral participation. Next, we will study patterns of voting behavior and vote choice and how electoral rules and context affect those. Finally, we will examine politicians and their relationship with voters as well as the choices they make in campaigns and elections.

<h3>Applied Data Analysis</h3> <i>Yonsei University (Undergraduate)</i>
  <br>This course is designed to introduce students to the methods and practices by which they can use data to answer questions in political science. The course will focus on helping students to understand the core concepts behind statistical inference and learn how to apply them appropriately to answering substantive problems of interest. In addition, a major component of the course includes learning how to collect, manage, and analyze data using computer software and how to effectively communicate results to others. Each week will consist of a lecture and in-class activities. Both lectures and in-class activities will be based on R, an open-source software that is widely used for data analysis in social science.

<h3>American Elections and Campaigns</h3> <i>Yonsei University (Undergraduate)</i>
<br> 
The U.S. is one of the best documented examples of advanced industrial democracies, and the study of U.S. politics helps us understand how politics works in other democracies around the world. This course provides an overview of the American political system and electoral processes. We will begin by examining the institutions and rules that structure U.S. electoral processes, such as voting rights, electoral rules, and campaign finance. We will then discuss recent issues and controversies in U.S. elections, including the role of the media, representation, accountability, and identity. This course aims to improve students' critical thinking and ability to understand empirical research. Throughout the semester, we will study both recent academic papers on American elections and textbook material that provides essential background information. Another goal of this course is to improve students' academic writing skills. Be prepared to do a lot of reading and writing!

<h3>Comparative Political Behavior</h3> <i>Louisiana State University (Graduate)</i>
<br>This course is designed to prepare graduate students to conduct research on political behavior in comparative contexts. This course provides an overview of active research on political participation, behavioral effects of political institutions, voting behavior, party competition, and elite responsiveness.
For each seminar, we will read a mix of foundational texts and recent research that demonstrates how innovative research design can shed new light on foundational questions in comparative politics. While some readings draw on American politics, we will also learn about cross-national differences and similarities in electoral processes and electoral institutions. The first part of this course will examine different models to explain individual and cross-national
variations in electoral participation. Secondly, we will study patterns of voting behavior and vote choice and how electoral rules and context affect those. Next, we will explore the varieties of electoral practices in new democracies and the challenges they face. Finally, we will examine politicians and their relationship with voters as well as the choices they make in campaigns and elections. In addition to the substantive content, this course will offer step-by-step guidelines on conducting
academic research on political behavior. Students will have an opportunity to read and discuss each process of academic research, including formulating a research question and hypotheses, writing a literature review, and developing a research design.
