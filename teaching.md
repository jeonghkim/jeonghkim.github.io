  <h3>  Introduction to Comparative Politics</h3>  <i>Louisiana State University (Undergraduate) </i>
  <br> This course provides an introduction to fundamental concepts, theories
and questions of the study of comparative politics. We will learn topics central
to understanding the political systems and political events around the world: democratization,
voting and elections, political parties, representation, and political violence. This course will give
students a basic understanding of how politics operates in the political systems around the world,
and how historical, cultural, economic, and institutional differences across countries affect politics
and policy-making.
